# AGI System Enhancement Plan

## 1. Current System Analysis

### 1.1 System Architecture Overview

The current system adopts a modular design, consisting of the following core components:
- **Central Coordinator**: UnifiedCoreSystem class integrates model management, collaboration engine, and optimization engine functions
- **Data Bus**: DataBus class is responsible for inter-module communication and message routing
- **Self-learning Module**: SelfLearningModule class supports multiple learning strategies
- **Knowledge Management**: KnowledgeGraphBuilder and ReasoningEngine provide knowledge processing capabilities
- **Functional Sub-models**: 10 specialized sub-models covering language, vision, audio, and other domains

### 1.2 Existing AGI Capability Assessment

**Implemented Features:**
- Modular architecture design supporting function expansion
- Multi-strategy autonomous learning system basic framework
- Knowledge graph construction and simple reasoning functions
- Basic emotional analysis mechanism
- Task allocation and execution system
- System resource monitoring and optimization

**Main Limitations:**
1. **Limited emotional understanding ability**: Only simple keyword-based sentiment analysis
2. **Weak reasoning capability**: Simple knowledge graph construction and reasoning functions
3. **Insufficient depth of autonomous learning**: Lack of complex meta-learning and strategy adaptation mechanisms
4. **Incomplete cross-modal collaboration**: Limited collaboration between modules
5. **Missing model evaluation system**: Lack of unified performance evaluation and optimization mechanisms
6. **Incomplete cognitive architecture**: Lack of consciousness, self-awareness, and long-term planning capabilities
