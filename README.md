## 📋 Project Overview

Self Brain is a comprehensive Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) management system designed to coordinate multiple AI models for language processing, computer vision, audio processing, spatial awareness, and device control.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **A Management Model**: Central AI manager coordinating all subsystems with emotional analysis capabilities
- **B Language Model**: Multilingual interaction with emotional reasoning
- **C Audio Model**: Speech recognition, tone analysis, audio synthesis, music recognition
- **D Image Model**: Content recognition, image modification, enhancement, generation
- **E Video Model**: Video content analysis, editing, modification, generation
- **F Spatial Model**: Spatial recognition, 3D modeling, positioning, distance perception
- **G Sensor Model**: Integration with various sensors (temperature, humidity, motion, etc.)
- **H Computer Control Model**: System control capabilities across multiple platforms
- **I Motion & Actuator Control**: Complex device control with multi-port output
- **J Knowledge Base Model**: Comprehensive expert system with various knowledge domains
- **K Programming Model**: Self-improvement through autonomous programming
