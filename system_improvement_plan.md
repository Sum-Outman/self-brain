# Self Brain AGI System Improvement Plan

## 1. System Overview
The Self Brain AGI system is a multi-modal autonomous learning system consisting of 11 interconnected models (A-K) managed by a main management model. The system includes a web interface, training capabilities, and various AI functionalities.

## 2. Improvement Goals

### 2.1 Core Model Improvements
- Implement true zero-shot training for all models
- Remove demonstration functionalities and placeholders
- Ensure all models can be trained with real data
- Enable genuine dialogue between the main page and main model
- Implement external API integration for all models
- Add autonomous knowledge base learning capabilities

### 2.2 Web Interface Improvements
- Convert all pages to English interface while maintaining Chinese conversation capability
- Enhance the multi-camera support for binocular vision functionality
- Add external device communication interface
- Add sensor integration interface

### 2.3 Architecture Enhancements
- Strengthen the data bus communication between models
- Improve the training scheduler and management
- Add hardware monitoring and control capabilities
- Ensure all system components work together seamlessly

## 3. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Improvements
1. Enhance main management model (A) to properly coordinate all sub-models
2. Improve language model (B) to support real conversations
3. Implement genuine knowledge base (J) with self-learning capabilities
4. Develop programming model (K) to enable self-improvement

### Phase 2: Web Interface and User Experience
1. Convert all web pages to English interface
2. Implement multi-camera support in the web interface
3. Develop external device and sensor integration interfaces
4. Add model configuration pages for external API connections

### Phase 3: Training and Self-improvement
1. Complete training implementations for all models
2. Implement autonomous knowledge learning functionality
3. Add model evaluation and performance tracking
4. Develop model fine-tuning and transfer learning capabilities

### Phase 4: Testing and Integration
1. Test all components together
2. Fix bugs and improve system stability
3. Ensure all external API integrations work properly
4. Optimize system performance

## 4. Technical Specifications
- All models will use PyTorch for implementation
- Web interface will use Flask and JavaScript
- Communication between components will use a combination of HTTP APIs and a data bus
- Training data will be stored in a structured format
- External API connections will follow standard protocols

## 5. Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional AGI system with 11 interconnected models
- Real training capabilities for all models
- Seamless integration with external APIs
- Autonomous knowledge learning functionality
- Enhanced user interface with multi-camera support
- Reliable external device and sensor integration
